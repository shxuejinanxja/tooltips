## Ownership

### stack and heap

- stack, FILO or LIFO last in first out, conjected in memory from bottom to top

- heap less orginized. alloctor find an empty spot and return back a pointer.

### Ownership Rules

- each value has an owner
- there can only be one owner at a time
- when the owner goes out of scope, the vaule will be dropped

### variable scope

- a scope is the range within a program for which an item is valid.

### memory and allocation

- the memory must be requested from the memory allocator at runtime
  - ` String::from`
- we need a way of returning this memory to the allocator when we're done with it.
  - path taken by rust:
    > the memory is automatically returned once the variable that owns it goes out of scope.
    > when a variable goes out of scope, Rust calls a special function `drop`

### ways varibles and data interact

- move

  - a String is made of three parts:
    - a pointer to the memory that hold the contents of the string
    - a length
    - a capacity

  ```rust
      let s1 = String::from("hello");
      let s2 = s1;
  ```

  to avoid `drop` twice when both s1 and s2 out of scope, Rust consider s1 as no longer valid after `let s2=s1`
  'let s2=s1' does not create a **shallow copy** of s1's three part. It's kind of **move**

- clone

```rust
let s1 = String::from("hello");
let s2 = s1.clone();
println!("s1 = {}, s2 = {}", s1, s2);
```

- stack-only data: copy
  Rust has a special annotation called `Copy` trait that we can place on types that are stored on the stack.  
  Rust won't let us annotate a type with `Copy` if the type, or any of its parts, has implemented the `Drop` traits

### Ownership and functions

> the mechanics of passing a value to a function are similar to those when assigning a value to a variable

### return values and scope

> returning values can also transfer ownship.

## Reference and borrowing

> a reference is like a pointer in that it's an address we can follow to access the data that stored at that address;that data is owned by some other variable. Unlike a pointer, a reference is guaranteed to point to a valid value of a particular type for the life of that reference.

### mutable Reference

one restriction: if you have a mutable reference to a value, you can have no other reference(mutable or immutable) to that value.

### dangling reference

> if you have a reference to some data, the compiler will ensure that the data will not go out of scope before the reference to the data does.

## macros

### println!

by default the curly brackets tell println! to use formatting known as Display to output intended for direct end user consumption.

### debug!

dbg! will return the ownship of the expression's value.

## slice

> a slice is kind of reference, so it does not have ownship. it let you reference a contiguous sequence of elements in a collection rather than the whole.

### string slice

```rust
fn main() {
    let s = String::from("hello world");

let hello = &s[0..5];
	let world = &s[6..11];

}

```

## struct

### struct update

the sync `..` specifies that the remaining field not explicitly set should have the same value as the fields in the given instance.

```rust
let user2=User{
email:String::from("another email"),
..user1
}

```

be aware that if the user one contain field like name:String then the data in the name field of user1 will be move to user2. it will make user1.name not usable.
but other field in the user1 is still accessable if they implement Copy trait.

### tuple struct

it have the added meaning the struct name provides but don't have names accociated with their fields.

```rust
struct Color(i32,i32,i32)
struct Point(f32,f32,f32)
let black=Color(0,0,0);
let origin=Point(0.0,0.0,0.0);

```

### unit-like structs without any fields

just like unit tuple which is `()`. the unit tuple represent an empty value
unit like struct is useful when you need to implement a trait on some type but don't have any data that you want to store in the type itself.

```rust
struct AlwaysEqual
let subject=AlwaysEqual;

```

### accociated functions

all functions defined within an impl block are called accociated functions because they are associated with the type named after impl.

## data type

### String, str, String literal and string slice

- [String](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/string/struct.String.html)

  - A UTF-8-encoded
  - growable string
  - interation with str
    - create from a literal string `let hello = String::from("hello");`
    - append a &str with push_str `hello.push_str("word");`
      - note if append a `char` it's `hello.push('w');`
  - create from a vector of UTF-8 bytes

  ```rust
  // some bytes, in a vector
  let sparkle_heart = vec![240, 159, 146, 150];

  // We know these bytes are valid, so we'll use `unwrap()`.
  let sparkle_heart = String::from_utf8(sparkle_heart).unwrap();

  assert_eq!("ðŸ’–", sparkle_heart);

  ```

  - deref

    - String implements Deref<Target=str> and so inherits all of str's method. it means that you can pass a String which takes &str by using a ampersand(&)

    ```rust
    fn takes_str(s: &str) { }

    let s = String::from("Hello");

    takes_str(&s);

    ```

- [str](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/primitive.str.html)
  - it's primitive type
  - aka string slice
  - string literals is type `&'static str`

### tuple, array and vector

- tuple
  - finte
  - heterogeneous : each element can have a different type and lifetime
  - sequence and accessed by position
  - access by period(.) `tup.1`
  - syntax `let x :(i32, 64, u8)=(100,5.4,1)`
- array
  - same type
  - fixed length
  - allocated in stack
  - syntax `let a:[i32;5]=[1,2,3,4,5];`
  - init array with same value `let a=[3;5]`
  - access `let first=a[0];`
- vector
  - changeable length

## item

an item is a component of a crate. A crate is a unit of compilation and linking, as well as versioning, distribution, and runtime loading.

## loop

### loop label

example

```rust
fn main() {
    let mut count = 0;
        'counting_up: loop {
	        println!("count = {}")
		loop {
		if count==0 {
		break 'counting_up
		}
		}
	}
}
```

### loop through collection by 'for'

- example

```rust
let a=[1,2,3]
for element in a{
  println!("{}",element);
}
// loop through Range
for num in (1..4).rev(){
  println!("{}",num);
}

```
